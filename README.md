# RenewableEnergyPatentThicketDetection
This repository is to house the code for my environmental studies senior project at Amherst College, searching for patent thickets among patents related to renewable energy technologies.  
The code is to be run in the order:
AssigneeDisambiguation.py
CleaningAndBenchmarking.rmd
MaintenanceFeeUnpacker.rmd
CleanGraphExploration.rmd
Within each script, file names will need to be changed to match your own filesystem.
